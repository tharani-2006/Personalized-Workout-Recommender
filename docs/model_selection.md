# Model Selection for Workout Recommendation

This document outlines the pros and cons of different machine learning models for the personalized workout recommendation task. We are considering Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

## Random Forest

**Pros:**

*   **Interpretability:** Random Forests are relatively easy to understand and interpret. You can analyze feature importance to see which factors are most influential in the recommendations.
*   **Robustness:** Random Forests are less prone to overfitting than some other models.
*   **Handles Categorical Features Well:** Can handle categorical features without extensive preprocessing (though encoding is still beneficial).
*   **Multi-class classification:** Naturally supports multi-class classification.

**Cons:**

*   **Performance:** May not achieve the same level of accuracy as gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM), especially with highly complex datasets.
*   **Training Time:** Can be slower to train than LightGBM.

## XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

**Pros:**

*   **High Performance:** Often achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of machine learning tasks.
*   **Regularization:** Includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
*   **Handles Missing Values:** Can handle missing values directly.
*   **Multi-class classification:** Naturally supports multi-class classification.

**Cons:**

*   **Interpretability:** More complex to interpret than Random Forests.
*   **Training Time:** Can be slower to train than Random Forest and LightGBM.
*   **Memory Intensive:** Can be memory-intensive with large datasets.

## LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

**Pros:**

*   **High Performance:** Similar to XGBoost, often achieves excellent accuracy.
*   **Fast Training Speed:** Generally faster training times than XGBoost and Random Forest.
*   **Memory Efficient:** More memory efficient than XGBoost, especially with large datasets.
    *   **Multi-class classification:** Naturally supports multi-class classification.

**Cons:**

*   **Interpretability:** More complex to interpret than Random Forests.
*   **Can Overfit:** More prone to overfitting than Random Forests, requires careful tuning.

## Recommendation

Given the need for interpretability and a potentially smaller dataset, we will start with **Random Forest**. This will allow us to quickly build a working prototype and understand the key factors influencing workout recommendations. We can explore XGBoost or LightGBM later to potentially improve accuracy.
